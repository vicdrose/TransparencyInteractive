	9/2: this is my last step on my journey of managing very unfortunate odds and turning it into a miracle by almost magical means. I've been living in Atlanta for about 13 days and it's awesome and it is also a challenge, when have I ever disliked challenges? (THAT ARE WORTH IT!) There is a lot of money and people living well here, lots of black people that are not retarded, lots of clubs and bars and tall buildings, the city is very spread out, it's hardly a city, it's a conglomeration of 20-30 tiny towns to me, with the downtown of Atlanta acting as a magnet or a center point on a compass.
	
	What is also here is a lot of social pettiness, but that is anywhere. It almost seems like a hub of black social pettiness. Not a complaint because I can simply avoid it, and what city worth living in isn't like this? I got some nice boots for $50 =).
	
	I'm glad to say me and my girlfriend have been going 2 months and 2 weeks strong! (lol) It's been extremely enjoyable to say the (absolute) least. I've been more focused than ever, making a decent amount of money, going to the gym, eating great, but also pushing myself harder than I ever have as a whole. I currently have 4 projects in development!! 2 for musicians, one for come-up planning, one for detaching from your location and taking risks. No more details will be shared cause I almost feel like I gave a software guy the opportunity to steal my 2 (at least) $10,000 ideas.
	
	Anyways, I gotta go to the gym. My guitar solo app should be done with phase 2 of my personal development cycle by next wednesday...I cant figure out how to get a fretboard on the screen!!!...I could just use an image...I just figured it out. Duh.	bye. <3
