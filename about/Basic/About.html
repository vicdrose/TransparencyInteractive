	Born July 21st in Milwaukee, WI to Victor Rose Sr and Trenee Wells. Avid videogame player from 3-18. I'm still impressed that I beat Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest at about 4 years old...I don't even think I could do that today. Huge Nintendo fan for a long time. Playstation is a great system also. Sypro Ripto's Rage was the first game I beat 100%. Crash bandicoot 3 Warped grabbing platinum medals is a great memory...plus the pizza hut demo discs giving me access to Taito titles. Good times.<br /><br />
	Attended about 10 schools, most noteworth of them being Hartford Elemantary, Glen Hills Middle School, Riverside High, and University of Wisconsin-Madison. I studied Computer Engineering at University of Wisconsin and now I am currently building a portfolio of software development material, beginning with this website.
	My goals are to make videogames, websites, and apps, and eventually make a platform for people to get paid for their creative ventures.
	Like an Uber for artists. Like soundcloud, and tumblr combined.

	I want to own my own videogame studio that houses the umbrella for an all-creative company that handles music, teaches music, sells music, and rents out instruments.
